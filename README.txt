In the root of this repository is a preprint of an article on the SPS submitted to Acta
Astronautica. It contains a lot of (hopefully) useful information on the system.

This system was designed by people working on the MIST and SEAM projects at the KTH Royal 
Institute of Technology.

We invite discussion, collaboration and help with implementing the system. Please contact
